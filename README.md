Welcome to Safety Path Generator Project
==============================

An ML model with user interface, to provide probability of certain crime occuring at any given time and date in future.     
The user interacts with the spatial map of the area(eg: Raleigh) to analyse the heatmap color coded with the probability of risk.    
This enables the user to avoids certains areas at certain points of the day, where their likelihood of becoming victims of a particular type of crime are higher.

AIatNCStateSpring2021SafetyPathGeneratorProject
==============================

This Spring 2021 AI at NC State project repository cotnains all of the machine learning prototyping code for the Safety Path Generator project. Acquiring tabular de-identified crime data from local college cities in North and South Carolina, cities in North and South Carolina, it seeks to harness the power of applied AI models to provide a heat map at any given time and place where incidences of crime per type are occuring and alert users of those areas, thereby providing with a path to take to avoid certains areas at certain points of the day where their likelihood of becoming victims of a particular type of crime are higher.
